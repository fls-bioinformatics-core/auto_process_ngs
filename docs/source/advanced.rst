Bash tab completion
*******************

The ``auto_process-completion.bash`` file (installed into the
``etc/bash_completion.d`` subdirectory of the installation location)
can used to enable tab completion of ``auto_process.py`` commands
within ``bash`` shells.

* For a global installation, copy the file to the system's
  ``/etc/bash_completion.d/`` directory, to make it available
  to all users
* For a local installation, source the file when setting up the
  environment for the installation (or source it in your ``~/.bashrc``
  or similar).
