Test data for Wafergen ICell8 QC pipeline
=========================================

The test data consists of an R1/R2 pair of FASTQ files with the
following associated barcodes and numbers of read pairs:

GGCTGGTAGGT	63 read pairs
GGTTACTCGGC	 9 read pairs
GTCGTCGCATC	49 read pairs

The `icell8_qc_pipeline.sh` script implements the QC pipeline
protocol as a shell script to allow independent verification of
the outputs from the pipeline.

The pipeline requires the following external programs:

- cutadapt
- fastq_screen
- bowtie/bowtie2

Also it needs the mammalian and contaminant Fastqscreen conf files
plus the relevant genome indexes.

To run on the test data do e.g.:

    ./icell8_qc_pipeline.sh -m ~/data/mammalian_genomes.conf -c ~/data/contaminant_genomes.conf
