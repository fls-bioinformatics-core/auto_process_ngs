Test data and scripts for Takara ICELL8 ATAC processing
=======================================================

Test data
---------

The test data comprises of an R1/R2/I1/I2 quartet of FASTQ files with the
following associated barcodes and numbers of read pairs:

CAGCAACG+GCTACGCT: 1 read pair  (sample 1)
TAACCAAG+TAAGGCGA: 1 read pair  (sample 1)
AATCTACA+CATCCTGT: 1 read pair  (sample 1)
TTCGTGCA+GATCCAAA: 1 read pair  (sample 2)
CGATAGGG+TTCCATAT: 1 read pair  (sample 2)
CGATAGGG+CGAGGCTG: 1 read pair  (sample 2)
TGATGAAA+CAATCTTA: 1 read pair  (sample 3)
AAGGAGTA+AAGAGGCA: 2 read pairs (sample 3)
CCTGCGGG+ATCACTCG: 1 read pair  (sample 10)
GACGTGGC+AGTAGATT: 2 read pairs (sample 10)

There is also a small "well list" file for these barcodes.

**Note that this data set requires that the I1 barcodes be reverse
complemented and subsequently that the I1 and I2 barcode sequences
be swapped**

Test scripts
------------

The `icell8_atac_demultiplexing.sh` script runs the demultiplexer on the
test data files in various configurations.
