# Contributing guidelines

The `auto-process-ngs` project has been developed specifically for use within the Bioinformatics
Core Facility at the University of Manchester, and is currently maintained by a single software
developer with limited time and resources.

As a result, while contributions are welcome, it may take some time before they are reviewed, and
bugs and feature requests which don't directly impact on our core facility's operations will
necessarily be treated as a lower priority than those which do.

We ask that you please be patient if your contribution is not addressed immediately, or if it's
rejected: neither of these should be seen as a reflection on the quality or value of your
contribution, or its importance to you.

If you still wish to contribute, please read the guidelines below for more information on how to do
so.

## Did you find a bug?

Before reporting a bug, please check whether it has already been reported by searching the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/auto_process_ngs/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem then you can
[open a new one](https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/auto_process_ngs/issues/new).

Please be sure to include **a title and a clear description** of the problem, with as much
relevant information as possible (for example, describing the commands or code that you ran,
the expected outcome, and the actual behaviour you observed along with any error messages).

Essentially the more chance we have of reproducing your problem, the more likely is that we
will be able to solve it.

## Have you written a patch that fixes a bug?

Please open a new GitHub pull request with a patch:

* Fork the repository and create a new branch for your patch
* Make your changes
* Ensure that any existing tests pass, and add new tests if appropriate
* Submit a pull request describing your changes

Please ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution, and include
the relevant issue number if applicable.

Examples of current and closed pull requests can be found via the
[GitHub pull request list](https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/auto_process_ngs/pulls).

## Do you want to suggest a new feature or enhancement?

Suggestions for new features or enhancements can be made by opening a new issue on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/fls-bioinformatics-core/auto_process_ngs/issues).
Please provide as much detail as possible about the feature you are suggesting, including the
problem it aims to solve and any potential implementation ideas you may have.

Alternatively, if you have already implemented the feature as a patch, please submit it as a
pull request as described above.

Please note however that unfortunately feature requests which do not directly impact on the
operations of the core facility are unlikely to be prioritised for implementation.

## Do you want to improve the documentation?

Contributions to the documentation are very welcome! If you have found an error, or think
something could be explained more clearly, please either create a new issue on the issue tracker
or submit a pull request with your proposed changes, as described above.

## What kinds of contributions are unlikely to be accepted?

Sorry - changes that are cosmetic in nature (for example, fixes to whitespace or reformatting
of code) and do not add anything substantial to the functionality of `auto-process-ngs` are
likely to be rejected without further consideration.

**Thanks for your interest in the project!**
